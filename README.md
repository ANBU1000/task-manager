# flutter_app

This is a minimal Flutter app scaffold created so you can run the original Flutter UI locally.

How to run (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install Flutter SDK: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. Open PowerShell and run these commands:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\anbpa\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If you only want to run the simple greeting as a Dart console app, run:

```powershell
dart run C:\Users\anbpa\OneDrive\Desktop\main.dart
```
